HasGuid
=======

A simple rails plugin that makes it easy to generate customizeable SEO friendly ID's that you can use in your routes/paths.

Example
=======

Add a string attribute to your model called "guid" and then simply add this line to your model:

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
   has_guid :name
end

You can specify any attribute for the guid to be based off of. So now if we do:

Post.create(:name => "Post? What post?")

# => Post(:name => "Post? What post?", :guid => "post--what-post-")

You can also pass a second attribute in as a scope.

   has_guid :name, :deleted_at

This will allow you to prevent unwanted problems with the uniquness_validation if you're using something like acts_as_paranoid.
